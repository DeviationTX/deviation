Building Deviation requires setting up a cross-compiler.  On certain
transmitters (like the devo7e), the firmware takes up nearly 100% of the
available ROM, and we have found that only specific versions of the
cross-compiler can build it successfully.

To facilitate building Deviation consistently, we have provided Docker images
to guarantee consistent builds across platforms.  Instruction for building with
Docker can be found here: http://www.deviationtx.com/wiki/development/docker

While not recommended, other methods of building Deviation are documented
here: http://www.deviationtx.com/wiki/development
