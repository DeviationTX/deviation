This repository is used to develop a new version 3.1 of the deviation software.

It is based on the great work which has been done for deviation 3.0, mainly 
by its initiator PhracturedBlue.

The original repository can be found here:
https://bitbucket.org/PhracturedBlue/deviation

=======================================================
This is the original README:

There are multiple targets available for building the Deviation firmware:

devo8:  This is the default target for the Walkera Devention 'DEVO8' transmitter
        It requires the gnu arm toolchain including gcc, and newlib
        To build, use:
           make

emu_devo8: This will build on the native platform (no cross-compiler needed)
           The main purpose of this target is to facilitate GUI development.
           This target requires FLTK to be installed.  See below for
           installing build enviornments
           For Linux:
             make TARGET=emu_devo8
           For Windows:
             make TARGET=emu_devo8 WINDOWS=1
           Cross-compile for Windows on Linux:
             make TARGET=emu_devo8 WINDOWS=1 CROSS=i586-mingw32msvc-

the default target is 'devo8'

Building for ARM (on Linux):
    I use the following script to install a cross-compiled gcc,
    and the relevant libraries:
           https://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain
Building for ARM (on Windows):
    Install the arm toolchain:
    1) download and install YAGARTO (install into /mingw/stm32)
        http://www.yagarto.de/#download
    1a) add YAGARTO to your PATH (I like to put this into ~/.profile
        so it is there each time I start msys)
        export PATH=/mingw/stm32/bin:$PATH
    2) ensure python is installed.  If not install it from here:
       http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/
    2a) Add python to your msys path:
       export PATH="/c/<path to python>":$PATH
       (e.g. export PATH="/c/Program Files/Python27":$PATH)

    Install fltk:
           apt-get install mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime
           <Download and unpack fltk source code>
           ./configure --disable-largefile --enable-localjpeg \

                       --prefix=/opt/fltk-w32
           make
           sudo make install
    Install portaudio:
           <Download and unpack portaudio source code>
           ./configure --prefix=/opt/portaudio-w32
           make

Building the Windows binary on Windows
#################################
    Install MingW:
    * Download the mingw installer from here: sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Ins...0120426.exe/download
    * Run the installer, and select 'C++', 'MSYS' and the 'Developer Toolkit'

    Install fltk:
    * Download fltk from here: http://fltk.org/software.php?VERSION=1.3.0&FILE=fltk/1.3.0/fltk-1.3.0-source.tar.gz
    * Start msys (you should have an icon, but otherwise run C:\MingW\msys\1.0\msys.bat
    * mkdir src
    * cd src
    * Untar fltk: tar -xzf <path to fltk download> (you can get to your C: drive in mingw using /c/Users/<user>/Downloads for example)
    * cd fltk-1.3.0
    * ./configure
    * make
    * make install

    Install portaudio:
    * Download portaudio from here: http://www.portaudio.com/archives/pa_stable_v19_20111121.tgz
    * Start msys (you should have an icon, but otherwise run C:\MingW\msys\1.0\msys.bat
    * cd src
    * Untar portaudio: tar -xzf <path to portaudio download> (you can get to your C: drive in mingw using /c/Users/<user>/Downloads for example)
    * cd portaudio
    * ./configure
    * make
    * make install

    Install Deviation:
    * Download the source code for deviation. You'll need mercurial to keep track of changes (which will require installing python), but you can manually download a zip of the source from bitbucket.org/PhracturedBlue/deviation
    * cd ~/src
    * cp -pf <path to deviation src code> deviation
    * cd deviation/src
