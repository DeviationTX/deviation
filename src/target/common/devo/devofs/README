The DevoFS filesystem is designed to provide a filesystem to very small FLASH 
memories with large sector sizes (ex 64kB flash with 4k sector-size). It is
optimized for flash layout efficiency over all else.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| NOTE:  It is not recommended to use this filesystem on devices with |
|                   larger than 512kB of FLASH space                  |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The only supported file attributes are file/directory bit and file-size.  No
other data is stored.  **** The maximum file size is 65535 **** (this could be
changed by adding an extra byte to the file-system header)

The file-system is a log-based filesystem with built in wear-leveling.
Sequential read and write speeds will be very fast, however, open and read-dir
functions will be quite slow.

DevoFS will slow down linearly with the number of files present, as well as
with the number of files written since the last compact() event

The filesystem will automatically run compact() when necessary, butit is
recommended to run it more frequently to optimize performance

The filesystem has an overhead of 15 bytes for each file and directory, and does
not require file alignment to sector boundaries.  Additionally, one sector must
be left vacant to allow for running the compact operation (unless the equivalent
amount of RAM is available)

A very simple algorithm is used:
   * find current filesystem start
       - will be sector aligned
       - not restricted to the 1st sector.  Will move backwards by one sector
         every time compact() is run
   * read file header (15 bytes)
   * use current file-header to identify start of next file-header
   * repeat until requested file/directory is found

Support for creating new files or directories is not currently implemented, but
could easily be added in the future.  Also, file-size cannot currently be
changed.

For efficiency, it is required that a directory be created before any files that
reside within that directory.  The code does not check this condition, and it 
leaves the burden to the developer

Reads and writes will automatically be partitioned to sector boundaries so the
sector-id bytes are not inadvertently read

DevoFS layout:
---------------------------------------

The constant values below assume the FLASH resets to 0xff.  negate all values if reset is 0x00

sector boundary
---------------
id/counter: 0x00 - start of filesystem
          : 0xff - empty sector

file
---------------
type/status:	file/dir/currently-writing/deleted
				ff: no more data in the sector
				80: directory
				0c: writing file (no size info)
				08: file
				00: deleted
parent-dir:		0 - 255
name:			8.3 (11 bytes)
size:			2 bytes
data:

directory
---------------
type:			80
parent_dir:		0-255
name:			8.3
id:				1-255

compacting
---------------
cursec = find sector 0
nextsec = cursec+1
emptysec = find sector 255
while (1) {
	copy all non-deleted data from cursec to emptysec
	while (! full) {
		fill emptysec with non deleted data from nextsec
		if (no more files) {
			clear cursec
			return
		}
		nextsec++
	}
	offset = nextsec index of uncopied data
	nextfile = bytes in nextsec to next file boundary
	clear cursec (now sector 255)
	cursec = nextsec
	nextsec = nextsec + 1 (may not be old cursec due to compressing multiple setcors)
}
