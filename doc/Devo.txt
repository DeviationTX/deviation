A 16 byte data packet is sent every 2.4msec
1.2msec after transmit, register 0x04 is checked to verify transmit status and ACK from Rx

The 1st byte of the data packet is one of:
0x85 - This appears to be used to transmit model data between transmitters
0x87 - Sent every 10 packets
       I do not know what the data is, however, I've only ever seen bytes 1-9 to be 0
       Bytes 10 - 15 are the same as for packets 0x8b and 0x8c
0x8a - 
       Only sent for the 1st 10sec or so.
       bytes 1 and 2  are a LSB-first word indicating the number of packets left before we stop sending 0x8a packets
       bytes 3, 4, 5 are the transmit channels that will be used to transmit data in a round-robin configuration
       bytes 6-9 contain the cyrf6936 ID.  This is used as an XOR for 0x87, 0x8b, and 0x8c packets
       bytes 10-12 are the same as for the 8b/8c packets (but are not scrambled)
       bytes 13-15 are the Fixed ID (though it isn't actually enabled) and ARE scrambled with the least-significant
          3 bytes of th cyrf6936 ID
       This packet is sent before every 0x8b or 0x8c packet for the 1st 10 seconds)
       If FixedID is in use, 0x8a is never sent, and 0x87 is sent instead
0x8b -
0x8c -
       0x8b and 0x8c packets are alternating packets.  These are the channel data
       each packet contains 4 16bit values (bytes 1 - 8) which are LSB 1st
       The sticks return '0' when centered and seem to max out at 0x640 at either end
       the upper-nibble of byte 9 indicates whether the channel value is positive/or negative
       I.e at the end of stick travel the value is 0x640 and bit 9.x indicates which end the stick is at

Packets 0x87, 0x8a, and 0x8b are 'encrypted' by xoring with the cyrf6936 id.  This is a 4 byte value.
       xoring is done by xoring all but the 1st byte of the  packet (i.e. everything but the cmd byte) 
       with the id.  i.e. pkt[1..4] ^ id, pkt[5-8] ^ id, pkt[9-12] ^ id, pkt[13-15] ^ (least significant 3 bytes of id)

The transmit channel is changed every 4 packets.  It appears to cycle between 3 values, 4 channels apart.  For instance:
       0x04, 0x08, 0x0c, 0x04, 0x08, 0x0c, ...

Packet 0x8b
0x8b:  aaaa bbbb cccc dddd ff gg hh ii jjjjjj
    aaaa: Elevator 9.7 is set when stick is below center
    bbbb: Aileron  9.6 is set when stick is right of center
    cccc: Throttle 9.5 is set when stick is below center
    dddd: Rudder   9.4 is set when stick is right of center
    ff: The upper nibble of byte 9 corresponds to whether the current stick value is positive or negative
        The lower nibble is '0x0b' on the Devo8 and '0x09' on the Devo6. Perhaps it is num_channels + 3?
    gg: The upper nibble is one of '0x00', '0x80', '0xc0'
        The lower nibble is the number of packets that will be transmitted (after this one) before the next
        transmitter channel is selected
    hh: The next transmitter channel that will be selected
    ii: The transmitter channel that will be selected afterthe next one (2 away)
    jjjjjj: Thye Fixed ID value (LSB 1st, 24bit value)
