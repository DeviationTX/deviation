This describes the wireless protocol for control of the Cheerson CX-10A and
CX-10 (blue).

1. Operating Phase

The controller and vehicle start in binding phase when powered on.  They tune to
the binding channel, 2402 MHz, and the controller transmits a binding request
packet every 6 ms until receiving a reply from a listening vehicle.  The
binding request packet includes a special binding vehicle identifier (VID) that
any vehicle may respond to.  The vehicle's binding response informs the
controller of its unique VID.  Subsequently, the controller transmits a request
containing that VID, and the vehicle replies with an acknowledgment.

After this four packet binding handshake, the controller and vehicle switch to
flying phase until powered off.  In flying phase, the controller transmits
control commands; the vehicle never transmits.  The devices follow a
four-channel repeated frequency hopping sequence derived from the controller's
unique identifier (CID).  The controller transmits each packet on a new
frequency in the hopping sequence, 5.25 ms after the start of the previous
packet on the previous frequency.

2. Packet Payload Format

Packets in both binding phase and flying phase have the same format.  The packet
payload has a fixed length of 21 bytes divided into 9 fields.  Each field is
transmitted LSB first.

2.1 Phase Field
    
    0xaa: binding phase
    0x55: flying phase

2.2 CID Field

    The hopping sequence is derived from the four least significant nibbles of
    the CID.  (See Frequency Hopping below.)

2.3 VID Field

    0xffffffff: binding VID

2.4 Aileron Field

    The aileron (roll) value is encoded as an integer ranging from 1000 (roll
    to right) to 2000 (roll to left).  It sometimes encodes special conditions
    in binding phase:

    0x00: indicates this is the first binding request or binding reply packet
    0x01: acknowledgment from vehicle before switch to flying phase

2.5 Elevator Field

    The elevator (pitch) value is encoded as an integer ranging from 1000
    (forward) to 2000 (backward).

2.6 Throttle Field

    The throttle value is encoded as an integer ranging from 1000 (off) to 2000
    (full throttle).  Note: 1000 observed in binding phase, 969 to 1938 observed
    in flying phase.

2.7 Rudder Field

    The rudder (yaw) value is encoded as an integer ranging from 1000 (rotate
    left) to 2000 (rotate right).

2.8 Flip Field

    1: Execute flip on next extreme aileron or elevator.

2.9 Mode Field

    0: junior (self-level) mode
    1: intermediate (rate) mode
    2: headless mode

2.10 CRC Field

    The 16-bit CRC is computed over all data fields, starting with the adress
    and ending with the mode field.  See src/protocol/spi/nrf24l01.c for
    details.

3. Packet Framing

Each packet begins with a synchronization word consisting of the following
binary sequence:

    sync word: 00000011100010000111101010101

Ignoring the first five bits, this is 0x710f55 in hexadecimal.

Following the sync word is a five byte address.  Every packet uses the same
address:

    address: 0xcccccccccc

The payload follows the address.  Following the payload is a one byte trailer:

    trailer: 0x49

4. Packet Whitening

Packet data, including the address and trailer, are whitened (scrambled) by
XOR with a fixed whitening sequence:

    0xe3, 0xb1, 0x4b, 0xea, 0x85, 0xbc, 0xe5, 0x66, 0x0d,
    0xae, 0x8c, 0x88, 0x12, 0x69, 0xee, 0x1f, 0xc7, 0x62,
    0x97, 0xd5, 0x0b, 0x79, 0xca, 0xcc, 0x1b, 0x5d, 0x19

5. Modulation

Packets are GFSK modulated at a rate of 1 Mbit/second and a frequency deviation
of approximately +/- 340 kHz.  Zero bits are represented by the lower frequency
deviation while one bits are represented by the higher deviation.  Each packet
has a duration of 245 microseconds and is preceded by an unmodulated carrier
for an additional 245 microseconds.

6. Frequency Hopping

The frequency hopping channel sequence in flying phase consists of four
channels, one from each of the following frequency ranges, in order:

    2403 - 2418 MHz
    2422 - 2437 MHz
    2445 - 2460 MHz
    2464 - 2479 MHz

The first channel frequency in MHz is determined by adding least significant
nibble of the CID to 2403.  The second channel is determined by adding the
second least significant nibble of the CID to 2422, and so on.

7. Credits

This document was written by Michael Ossmann based primarily on the deviation
source code and information in this forum thread produced by various fine
reverse engineers:

Secondarily, this was based on direct observations of the CX-10A.  The CX-10
(blue) uses a nearly identical protocol.
