I've been playing with a V911 transmitter which contains the A7105 FSK Tx/Rx chip. This transmitter uses 3-wire SPI to send data which makes it easy to look at.
The V911 is compatible with the Turnigy 9X/FlySky FS-TH9X, though it is only a 4-channel heli.

Initial analysis shows that all channel data is sent in 22-byte frames every ~1.5ms

The data in the frame is apparently not encrypted, and each channel is sent as a 16bit little-endian word.

The A7105 Data sheet can be found here:

After power-on, the following steps are initiated:
1) A7105 is reset send (0x00, 0x00)
2) Send 32bit address to address 0x06: 0x5475c52a
3) Program the A7105 control registers as follows:
Code:

0x00: --, 42, 00, 14, 00, --, --, 00, 00, 00, 00, 01, 21, 05, 00, 50
0x10: 9e, 4b, 00, 02, 16, 2b, 12, 00, 62, 80, 80, 00, 0a, 32, c3, 0f
0x20: 13, c3, 00, --, 00, 00, 3b, 00, 17, 47, 80, 03, 01, 45, 18, 00
0x30: 01, 0f, --

4) Put the A7105 into the 'Standby' state (Strobe = 0xa0)
5) Write '1' to address 0x02 to start the IF Filter Bank calibration
6) Poll address 0x02 until it returns '0' indicating calibration is complete
7) Read IF calibration info from Address 0x22
8) Write VCO Current calibration to 0x24 (value = 0x13)
9) Write VCO Bank calibration limits to 0x26 (value = 0x3b)
10) Write channel to Address 0x0f (value = 0x00)
11) Write '2' to address 0x02 to start VCO bank Calibration
12) Poll address 0x02 until it returns '0' indicating calibration is complete
13) Read VCO calibration from Address 0x25 (test for success?)
14) Write channel to Address 0x0f (value = 0xa0)
15) Write '2' to Address 0x02 to start VCO bank Calibration
16) Poll address 0x02 until it returns '0' indicating calibration is complete
17) Read VCO calibration from Address 0x25 (test for success?)
18) Write manual VCO Bank calibration to Address 0x25 (value = 0x08) ???
19) Put the A7105 into the 'Standby' state (Strobe = 0xa0)
20) Start sending frames as follows

Frames are sent each 1.46ms. Each frame consists of sending a 'FIFO Write Pointer Reset' (Strobe = 0xe0), 22 bytes of data, setting the channel (via the 0x0f register) and then sending 'TX mode' (Strobe = 0x0d) to actually initiate the transfer

The frame data is not encrypted, and is 16-bit little endian. the data appears to be as follows.
Fo each channel the minimum value I observed was ~ 0x03e8 and the maximum was ~ 0x07ca.
         TX1                 TX2
word 1:       0xaa05/0x5505
word 2: 0x01f3             0x0002
word 3: 0x2000             0x7000
word 4:         aileron
word 5:         elevator
word 6:         throttle
word 7:         rudder
word 8: 0x02c3             0xedfc
word 9: 0x02ed             0x02eb
word 10:        see below
word 11:        0x0000

Word 1 is 0xaa05 until 3 seconds have elapsed and the throttle has been broughtto its minimum value.  It then changes to 0x5505 at the same time that the Tx starts cycling between channels

word 8 and 9 are likely to be channels 5 and 6

Word 10 seems to continuously cycle between 10 states (changeing state every frame):
State 1     : 0x100, 0x200, or 0x300 (almost always 0x200)
State 2     : 0x23 or 0x24 (almost always 0x24)
State 3     : 0x32
State 4 - 10: 0xffe or 0xfff 

The Tx channel will be 01 until initialization is done and the throttle is brought to 0.  At ~ 3 seconds, data is transmitted on multiple channels.  Channel ordering is dependent on Transmitter?
Tx2: 0a, 5a, 50, a0, 14, 64, 46, 96, 1e, 6e, 3c, 8c, 28, 78, 32, 82
Tx1: 79, 29, 6f, 1f, 83, 33, 65, 25, 8d, 3d, 5b, 0b, 97, 47, 51, 01
