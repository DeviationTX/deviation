Thanks to rcH4x0r and renatopub for the data.

These transmitters use a CYRF6936 based solution.

Data is transmitted every 2.8 msec using 16-byte packets

After initialization, the Transmitter scans the RSSI for each channel 0x00 to
0x4f 30 times.  The 3 frequencies with the lowest RSSI are chosen for transmit

All packets sent from this point, will be sent on one of the 3 selected
frequencies.  Every 4 packets, the next channel is chosen in a round-robin
fashion.  Additionally all packets contain a sequence number from 0 to 12,
incrementing one after each packet.  All packets are 16 bits in length.

Next, if the radio is a 4 channel, a 12bit random ID is chosen.  If is is a 6
channel or if it is 8channel without a fixed ID, a random 20bit ID is chosen,
and Binding packets are sent.  The radio sends ~3000 binding packets, which
contain the chosen ID, and the chosen 3 frequencies.  If the radio is 8 channel,
and a FixedID is selected, the radio skips the binding stage.

After binding, data packets are sent.  A single data packet contains upto 8
channels of data in 10bit/channel.  The 4, 6, and 8 channel radios, all have
slightly different data packet syntax, but all contain the chosen ID and the proper
sequence number.

For 8-channel radio, a beacon packet is sent every 8 data packets.  This beacon
contains failsafe values for either the low-4 or upper-4 channels (alternating each
time the beacon is sent.  the beacon also contains the chosen frequencies and ID,
allowing the Rx to locate the proper Tx without binding packets.

The TxID is a 20 bit value.  Either a fixed or random ID chosen for this session.
TxID1 = FixedId & 0xFF
TxID2 = ((FixedId >> 6) & 0xFF) | (FixedId >> 18)
TxID3 = ((FixedId >> 14) & 0xFF) & 0xFF

# 8-channel Data Packet #
#########################
Each channel is 11-bits (10-bits + 1 sign bit).  All 8 channels are encoded in a single packet.
The upper 2 bits are packed, 4 to a byte in bytes 4 and 9.
Channel data is signed in ones-complement encoding

A value of 0x000 is servo center. The largest value is 0x190 (whch corresponds to 100% servo throw)
Positive/negative servo direction is controlled by byte 13

the channel direction (byte 13) is set as follows.
bit 0 : Throttle : 1 when value > prev value

# 8-channel Beacon Packet #

The checksum offset is different for beacon vs data packets.
Byte 9 will be either 99, 1b, or e4 for beacon packets
(none of which are valid for data packets)
The beacon packet alternates between an odd and even packet (set by byte 4.6)

# 6-channel Data Packet #
#########################
The 6-channel protocol actually provides 7 channels.
Each channel is 10-bits.  All 7 channels are encoded in a single packet.
The upper 2 bits are packed, 4 to a byte in bytes 4 and 9.
Channel data is signed in ones-complement.
The Gyro is unsigned with values ranging from 100 to 900
Trim data is mixed into the channel data but is NOT included in the Gyro data
