cyrfid for following packets: 49 ec a9 c4 c1 ff

Binding:
Binding seems to consist of sending data on channel 0x52 and listening for a response on channel 0x53 from the model
Once a reply has been seen an answer is sent on channel 0x54 (6 times)
The transmitted packet looks like this:
01 01 e9 49 ec a9 c4 c1 ff
aa bb cc dddddddddddd
aa            Possibly the packet type?
bb            ???
cc            ???
dddddddddddd  mfgid

The packet from the model (ch: 53) looks like this:
03 01 56 49 ec a9 c4 c1 ff fc ec 2b 4d b9 ff
03 01 e9 49 ec a9 c4 c1 ff d2 a7 6c c2 ad ff
aa bb cccccccccccc         dddddddddddd
aa           Possibly the packet type?
bb           ???
cc           ???
cccccccccccc mfgid
dddddddddddd rx-mfgid

The response back to the rx (ch: 54) mirrors the packet from the rx (with the exception of the 1st byte):
05 01 56 49 ec a9 c4 c1 ff fc ec 2b 4d b9 ff
05 01 e9 49 ec a9 c4 c1 ff d2 a7 6c c2 ad ff
aa bb cc dddddddddddd      eeeeeeeeeeee
aa           Possibly the packet type?
bb           ???
cc           ???

Data transmission:
After binding, The transmitter scans channels (looking for free channels?) It appears to settle on 3 channels which it uses in
a group of 4 via the sequence a b c a  a b c a ...
There is no evidence that the Tx communicates the channel sequence to the Rx.  It appears that b = a + 5 and c = b + 5
Data packets are sent every 3.4 - 3.75 msec within the sequence.  the pause between sequences is 13.3msec
It appears that the data packet is in no way associated with the Rx.  Despite the binidng handshake.  Once bound, a given model
will immediately bind to a given Tx, even if that Tx has subsequently been bound with a different model.

Each channel consists of 10-bits.  The upper 2 bits are packed 4-channels to a byte in bytes 13-15.  The protocol supports
a total of 12 channels.

PN codes:
The SOP code table is 19 entries long.
The index into the SOP table, and the CRC are calculated from the MfgID as:
sop_idx = (0xff & (MfgID[0] + MfgID[1] + MfgID[2] + MfgID[3] - MfgID[5])) % 19
crc = ((MfgId[1] - MfgId[4] + MfgId[5]) & 0xFF) + 
      ((0xFF & (MfgId[2] + MfgId[3] - MfgId[4] + MfgId[5]) ) << 8) 
The CRC is 0x0000 during binding.

The PN codes for the SOP are transformations of the recommended codes:
