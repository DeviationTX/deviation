Crazyflie/Crazyflie 2.0 Protocol (uses NRF24L01) 2017 May 18

# Description #
This protocol is for supporting the Crazyflie and Crazyflie 2.0 nanocopter.
Comprehensive details about this copter can be found on the crazyflie wiki and/or forum:
wiki: http://wiki.bitcraze.io
forum: http://forum.bitcraze.io

More specific info on DeviationTx support for the Crazyflie can be found on
the wiki here: http://wiki.bitcraze.io/misc:hacks:deviation

# Binding #
Binding is done automatically via a fixed three digit model ID. 
The first digit specifies the data rate:
0 = 250kbps
1 = 1Mbps
2 = 2Mbps

The next two digits specify the channel number.

Example: 280 = 2Mbps, channel 80.
Example: 000 = 250kbps, channel 0.

# Data Packets #
Data packets conform to the CRTP protocol outlined in the wiki
http://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie:crtp

This deviation protocol supports two types of commander packets, selectible in
the protocol options menu.
- RPYT = ordinary RPYT packets sent to CRTP port 3
  (http://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie:crtp:commander)
- CPPM = CPPM emulation mode sent to the generic setpoint port
  (http://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie:crtp:setpointgeneric)

# Channels #
Channel mapping depends on which CRTP mode is selected in the protocol
settings.

RPYT: Devo channels 0-3 are used for RPYT (AERT) and reordered (and sign
inverted as necessary) to match what the Crazyflie expects. Channel 4 is
optional and is used to rotate 45degrees to switch between '+' mode and 'x'
mode. This rotation is done in the protocol firmware itself. Channel 4 is not
transmitted to the Crazyflie.

CPPM: Up to 12 channels supported. All channels are remapped from their Devo
defaults to an emulated PWM value (1000-2000, where 1500 is the midpoint) and
none are sign inverted. Channels 0-3 are used for RPYT (AERT) and channels
4-11 are reserved for auxiliary functions as defined in the Crazyflie
firmware.

# Logging/Telemetry #
This protocol supports two different telemetry modes, selectable from the
protocol settings menu. In both cases, the protocol overloads the DSM
telemetry variables and UI as described below.

ACKPKT: Reports basic RSSI/VBat information contained in the ACK packet. This
information may not be present depending on the firmware version running on
the CFlie's NRF51. Telemetry UI mapping is as follows:
A (FADESA): RSSI (dB)
F (FRAMELOSS): Count of dropped packets
Bat (VOLT2): Voltage of the CFlie internal battery

CRTPLOG: Telemtry mode that utilizes the more complicated/extensible CRTP logging
framework (https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:crazyflie:crtp:log). Takes several
seconds at startup to initialize and start logging, but offers much more
flexibility to log any number of variables. Telemtry UI mapping is as follows:
A (FADESA): RSSI (dB)
F (FRAMELOSS): Count of dropped packets
Bat (VOLT2): Voltage of the CFlie internal battery
RxV (VOLT1): Voltage of the external battery (if present, i.e. on BigQuad deck)
