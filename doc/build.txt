Design Document for build system

Build system is using make.

src/Makefile - this is meta Makefile which has the logic to find the right target under target/ folder and build it by invoke another make. It defines each target as a build target, each family as a build target. In addition to zip_<target> etc to build zip package for certain target.
    Exported Variables:
        SDIR = the full path src folder

src/Makefile.inc - this is core of the build logic. This makefile compose the final build steps and execute them. This file should included as last one in Makefile.
    Import Variables:
    	TARGET = the target name, can be devo10 or emu_devo10
    	FAMILY = the family name
    	EXEEXT = the default exe extention name
    	
    	CROSS = set this to prefix of cross-compiler. otherwise leave it as empty

    	SRCS_C = the c files to be compiled
    	SRCS_CPP = the cpp files to be compiled
    	CFLAGS = the C compile flags
    	CXXFLAGS = the C++ compile flags
    	LDFLAGS = the link flags
    	INCLUDES = the folder to includes
    	DEFINES = the macro definitions

    	MOD_SRCS_C = the c files for module
    	MOD_CFLAGS = the c compile flags for module
    	MOD_LDFLAGS = the link flags for modules
    	
    	ALL = Additional targets beside $(TARGET).$(EXEEXT)

src/fs/Makefile.inc - this contains the logic to create filesystem folder for certain target
	Import Variables:
		TARGET = the target name
		FILESYSTEM = the filesystem to be choosed between different predefined sets
		FONTS = the fonts to be includes

src/target/<family>/<target>/Makefile - this file is entry point for build for target. It normally includes other makefile.inc to compose the build. Normally this file will includes src/target/<family>/common/Makefile.inc.
	Export Variables:
		TARGET = the target name
		SRCS = default the files
		ODIR = ODIR is defined as $(SDIR)/objs/$(TARGET)

	Import Variables:
		SDIR

src/target/<family>/common/Makefile.inc - this contains the logic to abstract common from a Tx family
	Import Variables:
		TARGET
		DTU_PARAM

	Export Variables:


src/drivres/mcu/<mcu>/Makefile.inc - this contains the logic for certain platform. For example, stm32 contains the logic for cross-compile and the logic to build libopencm3. x86 contains the logic to build tx on PC platform.

a typical include chain is like the following
	target/<family>/<target>/Makefile <-    target/<family>/common/Makefile.inc <- target/drivres/mcu/<mcu>/Makefile.inc
	                                                                            <- target/drivres/<other_drivers_type>/<driver>/Makefile.inc
	                                                                            <- fs/Makefile.inc
	                                                                            <- Makefile.inc
