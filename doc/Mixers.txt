The mixer system in Deviation is based on the ER9X firmware, but is not identical

# Mixer overview #
##################
Each mixer is made up of a Source, a Destination, a Scalar, an Offset, a Switch,
and a Curve.

Essentially a mixer can be thought of as implementing the following routine:
if (Switch) then
    Destination = f(Curve, Source) * Scalar + Offset
endif

A mixer can take another mixer's Destination as its Source, so mixers can be layered
to create arbitrarily complex control functions

At the end, each active output channel will have at least one mixer as its Destination

Mixers are defined in an order such that their pre-requisites are met before they are
evaluated.  Circular dependencies are not supported.

##################
# Mixer Ordering #
##################
In order to evaluate all mixers in a single pass, the mixers are maintained in an
ordered list.  The rule in creating a mixer is that if its Source or Switch are
the outputs of other mixers, then it must be defined after those definitions.

In order to ensure this, whenever a mixer is edited, all mixers are reordered to
achieve the above goal.

###################
# Mixer Templates #
###################
Because building mixer rules can be complicated, several predefined templates are
available.  Each of these has a customized configuration screen exposing the
relevant options.  A template can configure multiple mixers via a single screen,
hiding the complexity of connetcing them together properly.

Note that if a mixer template is used, and the template is changed, all the
mixers associated with that template will be lost
