SymaX protocol    2015 Mar 4

This protocol is used on the latest Syma models: X5C-1, X11, X11C, X12, new
X4, and new X6.  A variant supporting the original X5C and the X2 is
included as a protocol option.  Additionally the Syma X3, old X4, and
old X6 are supported with the SymaX4 option in the YD717 protocol.

These quads use the Beken BK2423 and BK2425 radio devices.  The protocol is
compatible with the nRF24L01+, with the addition of a special register set.
Note the "plus" version of the nRF device is required to support the 250kbits/s
data rate.

Data is transmitted every 4 msec using 10-byte packets.

Frequency hopping is used in both bind and data phases.  Four different channels
are used.  In the data phase 32 different sets of 4 channels are used depending
on the packet address.  All packets are sent twice to a channel before moving
to the next channel.

# Binding #
After initialization, the transmitter sends bind packets for about 1.4 seconds.
The tx address is sent in the first 5 bytes, followed by 3 bytes of 0xaa, then
0x00, then a one-byte checksum.

After the bind packets are sent, the tx changes its address and begins sending
data packets.

# Data Packets #
Each channel is 8 bits in sign plus magnitude format.

Trim values are sent in three separate bytes.  Trim values are 6 bits
sign plus magnitude.  The SymaX implementation drives the trim values in
parallel with the channel data to acheive additional control range.

Features are enabled by setting various bits in the data packet. When auto-flip
is enabled, full cyclic in any direction causes a flip to be executed in that
direction.  For models with cameras one bit controls taking pictures while
another turns video recoding on or off.

## Example data packet ##
Btye   Function
  0    throttle
  1    elevator
  2    rudder
  3    aileron
  4    bit 7    video on/off
       bit 6    take picture
       bit 5-0  0
  5    bit 7    high rates (always set 1 by SymaX)
       bit 6    1
       bit 5-0  elevator trim
  6    bit 7    0
       bit 6    auto-flip
       bit 5-0  rudder trim
  7    bit 7-6  0
       bit 5-0  aileron trim
  8    00
  9    checksum (all bytes xor'd together then added to 0x55)

# X5C protocol variant #
The original X5C protocol is similar.  The main differences are:
 - packet length is 16 bytes
 - channel values are in twos-complement format
 - the same tx address is always used
 - frequency hopping is not used

The last two points mean that models flown in the same area will interfere with
each other.
